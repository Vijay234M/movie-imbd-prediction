# 🎬 Movie IMDB Rating Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the **IMDB ratings** of movies based on various features like budget, cast, genre, etc. The code is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`moive.ipynb`).

## 📁 Project Structure

- `moive.ipynb` — Main notebook containing the complete code for:
  - Data loading and cleaning
  - Feature engineering
  - Visualization
  - Model training (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
  - Evaluation and predictions

## 🚀 Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- IMDB rating prediction using ML algorithms
- Model performance comparison
- Real-world dataset
- Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📦 Requirements

Make sure to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook moive.ipynb
   ```

2. Run all cells to train the model and see results.

## 🏆 Results

- Achieved good accuracy using regression models.
- Insights gained about key features influencing movie ratings.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor (if included)

## 🏢 Credits

- Developed by [Your Name]
- Internship project at **Vcodez**
- Includes experience with Python, data preprocessing, and model deployment

## 📌 Future Work

- Deploy as a web app using Flask
- Improve prediction using deep learning or more features
